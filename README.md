# YOLOv8 License Plate Detection

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of YOLOv8 for license plate detection The goal is to provide a clear, organized, and extensible codebase for training, evaluation, and inference of YOLOv8 models.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

```
yolov8-license-plate-detection/
├── data/
│   └──  (Dataset files will be stored here, e.g., images/, labels/, dataset.yaml)
├── models/
│   └──  (PyTorch model definitions, e.g., yolo.py, common.py, head.py)
├── utils/
│   └──  (Utility functions for data processing, bounding box operations, NMS, DFL, etc.)
├── config/
│   └──  (Configuration files for model architecture, training parameters, dataset paths)
├── predict.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### Directory Breakdown:

-   `data/`: This directory will host the dataset used for training and evaluation. It's recommended to place image and label files here, along with a `dataset.yaml` file that defines the dataset's structure and class names. For Roboflow datasets, the downloaded content can be placed directly into this folder.

-   `models/`: This folder will contain the core PyTorch model definitions. Each major component of the YOLOv8 architecture (e.g., backbone, neck, head) will be separated into distinct Python files for better organization and reusability. This includes classes like `Conv`, `C2f`, `SPPF`, `Bottleneck`, `DFL`, `DetectionHead`, `BaseModel`, and `DetectionModel`.

-   `utils/`: This directory is dedicated to helper functions and classes that support the main training and prediction scripts. This includes functions for bounding box conversions (`xywh2xyxy`, `xyxy2xywh`), image padding and unpadding, IoU calculation, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) related operations, and anchor generation. Separating these utilities ensures a clean and focused codebase for the model and training logic.

-   `config/`: All configurable parameters for the model, training process, and dataset will be stored here. This allows for easy modification of hyperparameters, model architectures, and data paths without altering the core code. YAML files are a good choice for this purpose, providing a human-readable and structured format for configurations.

-   `notebooks/`: The original Jupyter notebook (`yolo8(1).ipynb`) will be kept here for reference. This allows for easy comparison with the refactored code and serves as a historical record of the initial implementation.

### Core Files:

-   `train.py`: This script will encapsulate the entire training pipeline. It will load the dataset, initialize the model, set up the optimizer and loss function, and manage the training loop, including validation and model saving. This file will be the primary entry point for training new models or fine-tuning existing ones.

-   `predict.py`: This script will be responsible for performing inference on new images or videos using a trained model. It will handle loading the model weights, preprocessing input data, running the forward pass, applying post-processing steps (like NMS), and visualizing the detection results. This script will demonstrate how to use the trained model for practical applications.

-   `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that anyone setting up the project can easily install all necessary libraries, promoting reproducibility and ease of setup. This will include `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `opencv-python-headless`, `Pillow`, `PyYAML`, `tqdm`, and `roboflow`.

-   `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This typically includes build artifacts, temporary files, downloaded datasets, and sensitive information like API keys or model weights, keeping the repository clean and focused on the source code.

This structured approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier for others to understand, contribute to, and extend the project.
